# Just another Asteroid clone

This is my first foray into game development, and also my first usage of Godot (using version 4, because why not?).

I've created this to learn how to develop a simple game (Asteroids is a great start), so although I come from a software development background
and tried my best, some of the ways things are done in this project are probably not the best way to do things.

__Please note that the explosion sounds used are licensed sounds, so I'm afraid these cannot be reused freely.
All other sounds (music, lasers) have been created by me, so feel free to use them as you see fit (attribution appreciated).__
